MEAN app: MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, Node.js


----


# Compile/Run

Open WebStorm app.

The first time the WebStorm will tell you to do 'npm install' and do it, or the project will lack dependencies.

Run with bin/www file and put localhost:3000 at your website.

Then search any movie you want to get the result of the playlists recommends from Spotify.


## MongoDB notice

Please has your MongoDB setup and open. It will create the cs411 database automatically. 


----


# Problem

The IBM Watson API only has 5 emotions, so that's will limit our application of recommendation.

The Auth of Twitter may fail in some awkward cases.


----


# Open Source

Thanks for the API we are using:

* Spotify Web API
* TMDb API
* IBM Watson API


----


# Changes

As our original idea is to put songs and get the movie recommendation, but changes happened

Due to limitation and consideration, we revert it to put movie and get the playlist recommendation.
