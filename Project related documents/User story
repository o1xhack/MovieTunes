Our idea:

The user will input a spotify playlist, and we will use IBM Watson’s tone analyzer to measure the emotions of the playlist.  We will then use these to recommend movies based on genres taken from IMDb, and the user will also be able to enter a keyword to filter movies further based on their plots.


Use Cases:

As a logged-in user, I want to select a playlist that I have created on my own or one of Spotify’s curated playlists to generate recommendations from IMDb.  
As a logged-in user, I want to process the inputted playlist to display the sentiment gathered from the playlist.  
As a logged-in user, I want to save selected movies from the recommendations so that I can watch them later.

Users will login using their Spotify accounts. The users’ Spotify playlists will appear and can be selected to go through the sentiment analysis. The result of the analysis will be displayed graphically. The web app will also list a selection of movies that are similar in mood to the playlist.  After the list of movies have been displayed, a user wants to be able to select which ones they want to save for later and which ones they want to delete.  They will be able to click checkboxes next to each title and then have options allowing them to save to their profile or delete from the list.
